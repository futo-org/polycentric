# Implementation Plan for Polycentric Core React Native Port

This document outlines a structured approach to port the Polycentric Core
library to React Native, focusing on minimal changes to maintain compatibility
with the existing codebase.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup and Analysis

### 1.1 Project Setup

- [ ] Fork/branch the existing repository
- [ ] Set up a React Native test application for development and testing
- [ ] Configure TypeScript and build tools for React Native compatibility
- [ ] Install React Native specific dependencies:
  - [ ] `react-native-mmkv` for storage
  - [ ] `@react-native-community/netinfo` for network information

### 1.2 Dependency Review

- [ ] Review all dependencies for React Native compatibility
- [ ] Identify alternatives for any incompatible dependencies
- [ ] Create a compatibility table for all dependencies:

| Dependency         | Compatible with RN? | Alternative               |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |

## Implementation Approach

To minimize changes to the existing codebase, the following approach is
recommended:

1. **Isolation**: Keep React Native specific code in separate files where
   possible
2. **Extension**: Extend existing interfaces rather than modifying them
3. **Compatibility**: Ensure API compatibility with the web version
4. **Progressive Implementation**: Start with the persistence layer, then
   networking, and finally optimizations

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase                                | Estimated Time    |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Phase 1: Setup and Analysis          | 1 week            |
| Phase 2: Persistence Implementation  | 2 weeks           |
| Phase 3: Networking Adaptations      | 1 week            |
| Phase 4: Cryptographic Optimizations | 1-2 weeks         |
| Phase 5: Testing and Validation      | 2 weeks           |
| Phase 6: Documentation               | 1 week            |
| Phase 7: Deployment                  | 0.5 week          |
| **Total**                            | **8.5-9.5 weeks** |

## Key Challenges

1. **Storage Implementation**: Creating a performant implementation of
   abstract-level using React Native storage
2. **Binary Data Handling**: Ensuring efficient handling of binary data in React
   Native
3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Maintaining consistent behavior across iOS
   and Android
4. **Performance**: Ensuring good performance on lower-end mobile devices

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass on both iOS and Android
2. API compatibility with web version
3. Satisfactory performance metrics:
   - Startup time < 2 seconds
   - Posting latency < 500ms
   - Synchronization of 100 events < 5 seconds
4. Storage persistence across app restarts
