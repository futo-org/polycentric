# Polycentric Core React Native Port Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to port the Polycentric Core library to React Native, with a focus on Android support.

## Key Changes

### 1. Persistence Layer

The most significant change was implementing a React Native-compatible persistence driver using MMKV:

- Created `MMKVAbstractLevel` class that implements the `AbstractLevel` interface
- Implemented key storage operations: `_get`, `_put`, `_del`, `_batch`
- Added iterator support for range queries and batch operations
- Created encoding/decoding helpers for binary data
- Exported a new `createPersistenceDriverReactNative` function

### 2. Networking Enhancements

Improved the networking layer for mobile environments:

- Implemented timeout handling via `timeoutFetch`
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff via `fetchWithRetry`
- Created `enhanceRequestOptions` helper for consistent header management
- Updated all API methods to use these enhanced networking functions
- Added proper content type headers for binary data

### 3. Build Configuration

Updated the build configuration for React Native compatibility:

- Added React Native specific dependencies (`react-native-mmkv`)
- Changed build targets from `browser` to `neutral` platform for ESM/CJS bundles
- Created platform-specific exports

### 4. API and Helper Functions

Added React Native specific helper functions:

- Created `createRNProcessHandle()` for simplified setup
- Added example usage in `react-native-test.ts`
- Updated README with React Native specific documentation

## Files Modified

1. `persistence-driver.ts`: Added MMKV-based persistence implementation
2. `api-methods.ts`: Enhanced networking with timeout and retry logic
3. `index.ts`: Added React Native specific exports and helpers
4. `package.json`: Added dependencies and updated build configuration
5. `README.md`: Updated with React Native specific documentation

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Minimal Changes**: Modified only what's necessary for React Native compatibility
2. **Performance Optimized**: Added mobile-specific optimizations for networking and storage
3. **API Compatibility**: Maintained the same API as the web version
4. **Native Integration**: Leveraged React Native's native capabilities via MMKV

## Testing Strategy

The implementation can be tested by:

1. Using the test helpers in `react-native-test.ts`
2. Creating a simple React Native app that initializes the library
3. Testing basic operations like posting content and querying data
4. Verifying data persistence across app restarts

## Next Steps

To complete support for all platforms:

1. **iOS Support**: The current implementation should work on iOS without modification
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with large datasets on real devices
3. **Integration Testing**: Create a sample React Native app to test all features
